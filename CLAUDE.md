## Current state (2026-05-20)

- **Latest commit on `main`:** `2649a9b` — feat(seo): per-report/article schema + OG/Twitter + Organization JSON-LD (item 7.3-remainder)
- **Production:** live, Vercel auto-deploys on every push to main
- **Last fully-verified green CI run:** commit `a8a9206` (legacy cleanup). Dashboard commit `eb05464` and this session's 7.3-remainder commit go out together — verify in Actions tab.
- **CI:** smoke test workflow at `.github/workflows/post-deploy-smoke.yml` — runs on every push to main + manual via Actions UI
- **Smoke tests:** 45 shallow checks at `tests/smoke.spec.js` covering static pages × 3 locales, slug rewrites, root redirect, legacy redirects, admin auth gates, public APIs, **SEO surface (robots.txt + sitemap.xml + sitemap-{locale}.xml + hreflang `<link>` + Organization JSON-LD + per-report Product JSON-LD + per-article Article JSON-LD)**.
- **SEO surface verified in prod** (curl ground truth): `/robots.txt` ✅, `/sitemap.xml` returns sitemap index ✅, `/sitemap-{en,ja,ko}.xml` return urlsets with hreflang annotations ✅. Schema markup verification by post-deploy smoke.
- **Open warning:** GitHub Actions Node.js 20 deprecation. Forced migration to Node 24 by 2026-06-02. Non-blocking — action authors will update before then.

```

Key Vercel rewrite pattern (final, stable):
```
/<locale>/reports/:slug  → /en/reports/_view
/<locale>/insights/:slug → /en/insights/_view
```
Two things matter here:
- `:slug` is plain (no inline regex). Vercel's path-to-regexp silently
  drops complex patterns; filesystem check runs before rewrites so
  concrete files (`_view.html`, `template.html`) still serve directly.
- Destination uses **no-extension form**. `cleanUrls` strips `.html`
  from rewrite destinations internally, so writing `_view.html` makes
  Vercel look for a file literally named `_view` (no extension) → 404.
  Writing `_view` lets cleanUrls forward-map to `_view.html` correctly.

## Owner action items (BLOCKING — owner must click through)

These are tasks only the owner can do (involve dashboards, not git):

1. ☐ **Run 4 Supabase migrations** in dashboard SQL Editor, in order:
   - `supabase/migrations/001_leads.sql`
   - `supabase/migrations/002_library.sql`
   - `supabase/migrations/003_insights.sql`
   - `supabase/migrations/004_purchases.sql`
2. ☐ **Set Vercel env var** `ADMIN_EMAILS=henryvn2004@gmail.com`
3. ☐ **Verify Vercel env vars exist** (Settings → Environment Variables):
   - `SUPABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` (server-only — never expose to client)
   - `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID`
   - `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - `PAYPAL_MODE` (= `sandbox` or `live`)
   - `APP_URL` (= `https://kiraresearch.com`)

### Done (no further action needed)

- ✅ Repo is public, GitHub Actions running free
- ✅ Smoke CI workflow live and green (41 checks)
- ✅ `/en/reports/<slug>` + `/en/insights/<slug>` rewrites verified by CI
- ✅ Legacy URL redirects (`/library.html`, `/report.html`, etc.) verified by CI
- ✅ Admin auth gate on `/en/admin/*` verified — unauthenticated users redirected
- ✅ Public API endpoints respond with JSON, leads endpoint rejects GET, admin-leads rejects unauth
- ✅ SEO surface live: `/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml` (index), `/sitemap-{en,ja,ko}.xml` (per-locale with embedded hreflang). Per-page `<link rel="alternate">` injected by nav.js on every page load.

### New owner action (unblocked by SEO sprint)

4. ☐ **Submit sitemap to Google Search Console** — once per locale property:
   - GSC → Property → Sitemaps → add `https://kiraresearch.com/sitemap-en.xml`, same for `ja` and `ko`
   - Requires domain ownership verification first (DNS TXT or `google-site-verification` meta tag on `index.html`)
   - Optional: submit `https://kiraresearch.com/sitemap.xml` (the index) once for any property

## Next queue (pick one)

Aligned with the workplan phase/sprint structure. Each item maps to one or
more pending sprints in `project des/workplan.md`. Recommended order:

- ~~**C — Sitemap.xml + robots.txt + full hreflang**~~ ✅ **DONE** (`6bb331f`…`8bcb6d4`). Closed Sprint 3.3, ~70% of 8.1+9.1; 7.3 partial.
- **D — PDF upload via Supabase Storage** → unblocks Sprint **6.2** (PDF export pipeline) + **8.2** JA PDFs.
  Wire `library-content.js` to return real signed URL from Storage bucket. Add admin upload UI. ~1 day.
- **E — Transactional email** (purchase receipt + lead notify) → fills Phase **6** ops gap (out of original workplan, but blocks healthy revenue UX).
  Pick provider (Resend recommended). Year 1 = simple sends only. ~half-day.
- ~~**7.3-remainder — Per-report schema markup + Open Graph + JSON-LD**~~ ✅ **DONE** (this session). `_view.html` for reports + insights inject per-page OG/Twitter Card + Product/Article JSON-LD + BreadcrumbList. `nav.js` injects Organization JSON-LD globally. 4 new smoke tests cover it (45 total now).
- **4.3 — Transactions + Users admin** → revenue tracking UX.
  `/en/admin/transactions` list view + detail + manual refund button. Reuses `purchases` table. ~1 day.
- ~~**F — Legacy file cleanup**~~ ✅ **DONE** (`a8a9206`). 29 files / 11,138 lines removed. Closed Sprints 2.3 + 5.3.
- ~~**H — KPI dashboard + audit log**~~ ✅ **DONE — dashboard shipped** (`eb05464`). Closed Sprint 4.1 dashboard half. Audit log deferred.
- **G — Native reviewer QA pass on JA/KO copy** → fills Sprint **8.1** + **9.1** native reviewer items.
  Ship JA/KO drafts to a native Upwork reviewer ($50-100/locale), fold fixes back in. First 10-20 reports per locale per `project des/CLAUDE.md`.

## Hard constraints (do NOT violate)

From `project des/CLAUDE.md` — repeated here so a new session sees them immediately:

- ❌ Never position as "AI-powered platform / SaaS / app" — we are a **research house**
- ❌ Never claim volume ("1000+ reports", "thousands of studies")
- ❌ Never lead with "AI" in marketing copy — only mentioned on `/methodology`
- ❌ Never use competitor names in copy: Mordor, Frost, Euromonitor, Synovate, Ipsos
- ❌ Never use "Claude" or "McKinsey" in UI copy
- ❌ Never give CLI instructions to owner — always click-through (Vercel/Supabase/GitHub UI)
- ❌ Never use Next.js syntax in `vercel.json` (no `beforeFiles` / `afterFiles`)
- ✅ Brand voice: "our analysts" / "our research team" / "we" — never "our platform"
- ✅ Trilingual EN/JA/KO from Day 1, flat $39 pricing Year 1

## Gotchas learned the hard way

1. **Vercel blocks deploys if commit author email isn't matched to a GitHub account.**
   - First-time setup on a new machine, MUST run:
     ```
     git config user.email henryvn2004@gmail.com
     git config user.name  henryvn2004-arch
     ```
   - If already pushed bad commits, rewrite history with `git filter-branch --env-filter` then `git push --force-with-lease`.

2. **Vercel `cleanUrls: true` is required** or `/en/library` (file: `library.html`) 404s.

3. **Vercel rewrite slug patterns: keep them plain.** See gotchas #11 and #13 below — `:slug` (no inline regex) + no-extension destination is the only combination that reliably works with cleanUrls. The negative-lookahead pattern `:slug((?!_view$|template$).+)` that worked in earlier Vercel docs is silently dropped by their current parser.

4. **`npm install` not `npm ci` in CI workflow** — no `package-lock.json` committed yet. When/if one is added, switch to `npm ci`.

5. **No hardcoded secrets in `public/`** — that folder is publicly served. Anon Supabase keys are OK (they're meant to be public, protected by RLS). Anything else = leak.

6. **Reading file from wrong shell cwd** — after `cd kira-research && ...`, the shell stays inside `kira-research/`. Subsequent `cd kira-research` errors. Always `pwd` first or use absolute paths.

7. **`.logo-mark` exists in TWO places** — `nav.js` injects it in the top nav AND in the footer. Playwright strict-mode (default) errors when a `locator('.logo-mark')` matches both. Always scope to `.nav-wrap .logo-mark` (or `.kira-footer .logo-mark` for the footer check) — or use `.first()` for quick triage.

8. **Page titles use mixed case `"KIRA Research"`**, not all-caps `"KIRA RESEARCH"`. Brand mark in nav is rendered all-caps via the CSS class `.logo-mark`, but `<title>` text is mixed case. Test with `/KIRA Research/i` or just `/KIRA/i`.

9. **`cleanUrls: true` strips `.html` from URLs** — admin JS redirects to `/auth.html` but the browser lands on `/auth`. Any URL assertion involving HTML files must accept both forms: `/\/auth(\.html)?(\?|$|\/)/`.

10. **`cleanUrls` BREAKS redirects whose source ends in `.html`** — Vercel normalizes `.html` requests FIRST (308 to no-extension), then matches redirects against the normalized path. So `{ "source": "/library.html", ... }` never fires because by the time the redirect runs, the path is already `/library`. Always write redirect sources in the no-extension form (`/library`, `/about`, etc.).

11. **`cleanUrls` ALSO breaks rewrites whose `destination` ends in `.html`** — when the destination is `/foo/_view.html`, Vercel applies cleanUrls to the rewrite destination and looks for a file at `/foo/_view` (no extension), which doesn't literally exist on disk → 404. Write rewrite destinations in the no-extension form too (`/foo/_view`). The cleanUrls forward map handles serving `_view.html` from there.

12. **Legacy root HTML files SHADOW redirects** — `public/library.html`, `report.html`, etc. (from the platform era) make their corresponding redirects no-op because filesystem lookup wins. When adding a redirect for a path, ALSO delete the file at that path if it exists.

13. **Rewrite slug patterns: keep them simple.** Vercel's path-to-regexp silently rejects complex inline patterns like `:slug((?!_view$|template$).+)` — the rule loads but never matches. Use plain `:slug` (single segment). Filesystem check runs before rewrites, so concrete files like `_view.html` and `template.html` still serve directly.

## Pickup checklist for new Claude session

When this conversation continues on a different machine:

1. ✅ Read this file (you just did)
2. ✅ Read `project des/CLAUDE.md` for full project context (brand, schema, decisions)
3. ✅ Skim `project des/site-architecture.md` if working on routing/pages
4. ✅ Skim `project des/workplan.md` if planning multi-sprint work
5. ✅ Run `git log --oneline -10` to see what's freshest
6. ✅ Check **Actions** tab on GitHub — latest smoke run pass/fail
7. ✅ Ask Henry: which next-queue item to pick, or any new bug surfaced
8. ✅ Before any commit: verify `git config user.email` = `henryvn2004@gmail.com`
9. ✅ Before any push: run `npm run test:smoke:local` if change touches routing/pages/forms

## Communication style

- Owner speaks Vietnamese mixed with English technical terms
- Mirror that register — informal Vietnamese for tone, English for system/code/UI terms
- Owner is non-technical: explain **why** + **click-through how**, never CLI to owner
- Be honest about tradeoffs and risks; flag blockers explicitly
- Use TaskCreate/TaskUpdate for multi-step work; one-off small tasks can skip
- After completing a workplan sprint: tick its checkbox in `project des/workplan.md`, update the Workplan-progress matrix in this file, and bump "Current state" date
