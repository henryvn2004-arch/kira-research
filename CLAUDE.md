# KIRA RESEARCH — Sprint Progress & Pickup Guide

> **Purpose of this file:** Single source of truth for a new Claude Code session
> to pick up this project from where the last session left off.
>
> **For project context** (brand, positioning, IA, schema, decision log) →
> read `project des/CLAUDE.md` after this one.
>
> **For accumulated session memory** (gotchas, build phases, owner profile) →
> read `project des/memory/MEMORY.md` for the index, then specific notes as
> needed. On a new machine, mirror those files back into the local Claude
> memory dir (`~/.claude/projects/.../memory/`) for runtime pickup. See
> `project des/memory/README.md` for the sync pattern.

## Current state (2026-05-30 — Company Intelligence Sprints 2–9 DONE)

**Phase R: Company Intelligence engine — Sprints 0–9 complete. 250 companies live on prod. Unified search landing page live.**

Sprint 0 complete (`279304c` + `14942a6`):
- 7 tables live on Supabase: `entities`, `sources`, `facts`, `relationships`, `coverage`, `raw_documents`, `company_reports` + `company_graph_bfs()` RPC
- Multi-country schema: `country_code` (default `VN`) + `tax_id` composite unique — supports VN/JP/KR/AU/SG/MY/ID/TH/PH/NZ
- `api/_lib/company/` — config, normalize (per-country legal token strip), connector, search, pipeline
- `api/company-search.js` (`?tax_id=&country=VN`, legacy `?mst=` ok) + `api/company-report.js`

Sprint 1 complete (`cf6a0b4` squash-merged 2026-05-29):
- **Migration 017 live**: 25 top VN companies seeded, ĐKKD connector, Pipeline Stage 2 + 6, SEO `_view.html`, vercel.json rewrites.

Sprint 2 complete (`31b3608`):
- **Migration 018+019 live**: 200 VN companies total (HOSE/HNX + private sector). Key Players strip on report pages (`loadKeyPlayers()` in reports `_view.html`). Sitemap updated.

Sprint 3 complete (`492a705`):
- `/en/companies/vn/` index page — filterable by industry/sector, search box, loads from `/api/company-list`. Migration 019 (200 companies) applied.

Sprint 4 complete (`5bfdc2a`):
- **Progressive pipeline enrichment** — company page visit triggers Stage 2 (ĐKKD), Stage 3 (masothue scraper), Stage 4 (Tavily web search) inline if not yet cached. Real facts visible on first load. masothue connector + Tavily connector live.

Sprint 5 complete (`859f13c`):
- **LLM narrative synthesis** (Stage 5) — Claude Haiku writes ~500-word analyst narrative per company after enrichment stages. Cached in `company_reports.payload`. `api/company-enrich.js` orchestrates all stages.

Sprint 6 complete (`9da5d76`):
- **Smoke tests** — 5 company intelligence tests added to `tests/smoke.spec.js` (company directory, company page, `/api/company-list`, `/api/company-report`, `/api/company-enrich` POST-only). `/en/admin/companies` + `/api/admin-companies` auth gate tests added. Total: **49 smoke tests**.

Sprint 7 complete (`0d4e859`):
- **Admin panel** `/en/admin/companies` — KPI strip (total/enriched/with_narrative/pending), searchable table, coverage badges (ĐKKD/MST/Web/LLM), per-row Enrich button. `api/admin-companies.js` auth-gated. Companies link added to all 8 admin sub-navs.

Sprint 8 complete (`c4be8c0` + Migration 021 applied via MCP):
- **50 JP companies seeded** — 9 sectors: Automotive, Technology/Electronics, Telecom, Banking & Finance, Retail, F&B, Healthcare, Materials, Trading/Conglomerates. 法人番号 (13-digit) as `tax_id`. Facts + company_reports stubs + coverage rows seeded. Admin panel updated with JP country filter.
- **DB totals**: VN=200 · JP=50 · **Total=250 companies on prod**.

Sprint 9 complete (`33db1be` — squash-merged PR #24 from `feat/company-search-landing`):
- **Unified company search landing page** `/en/companies/` — country selector (10 KIRA countries) + live typeahead input with 300ms debounce.
- `api/company-search-live.js` — GET `?q=&country=VN`, DB-first (entities + embedded company_reports slug), OpenCorporates fallback if < 3 DB hits. Returns up to 5 suggestions `{ name, tax_id, country, slug, source }`.
- `api/company-stub.js` — POST idempotent entity + company_reports stub creation for OC-discovered companies not yet in DB. Returns `{ slug, entity_id }`.
- Keyboard nav (↑↓ Enter Escape) on dropdown. DB hits redirect directly; OC hits POST to stub then redirect.
- Country grid: VN + JP as active `<a>` links; KR/AU/SG/MY as `.co-soon` spans.
- `vercel.json` — 2 new locale rewrites: `/ja/companies/` + `/ko/companies/` → `/en/companies/`
- 3 new smoke tests (52 total): landing page load, search-live API, company-stub POST-only gate.

**Live URL patterns**:
- Unified search: `/en/companies/`
- VN: `/en/companies/vn/vn-vingroup-0101231488`
- JP: `/en/companies/jp/jp-toyota-motor-corporation-9180301018771`
- Directory: `/en/companies/vn/` (filterable)

**Owner workflow:** Henry travels 2026-05-29 to ~2026-06-02. Chats daily via Claude mobile app.
Each sprint = 1 PR → Henry merges on GitHub mobile → Vercel auto-deploys.
DB migrations: Claude applies via Supabase MCP directly (no owner Supabase action needed).

**Next: Sprint 10 (TBD)** — possible directions:
1. `/en/companies/jp/` index page for JP directory
2. Fix admin company profile link — currently hardcodes `/en/companies/vn/` (JP companies need `/en/companies/jp/`)
3. JP connector — 法人番号公表サイト API for legal status/address enrichment
4. SEO: `/en/companies/jp/_view.html` page template for JP company profiles

## Previous state (2026-05-27 — honest surface + favicon + stub cleanup + perf session)

Seven small-but-shippable items, all live on prod by end of session:

- **Live counts on home + library** (`cc1fa29`) — Hardcoded fake counts (128 reports, 22 FMCG, 14 Fintech etc.) on `/<locale>/` "Industries we track" and `/<locale>/library` facet sidebar replaced by a single inline-deferred script (`/js/live-counts.js`) that hits `/api/library-list?limit=200` once and aggregates by industry/country/year/price-band. Cells with 0 reports hidden. DB industries without a hardcoded sidebar row (Coffee, SaaS, 2027 etc.) get auto-appended. Each homepage `.ind-cell` carries `data-industry-key` (comma-separated DB-industry list, e.g. `f&b,coffee,aquaculture`). Honest surface beats impressive fake numbers when there's a "Buy" button at the end of the funnel.
- **Dynamic hero reports on home** (`874b495`) — Same `/js/live-counts.js` script now also populates the homepage hero panel ("Latest Research", 4 compact rows) and Featured grid ("Recently refreshed", 3 cards) from the same `/api/library-list` fetch. Markup containers carry `data-live-reports="panel"` and `data-live-reports="grid"`; hardcoded HTML acts as skeleton during the brief fetch window. Fixes 3 broken hardcoded slugs that were 404'ing since launch (indonesia-fmcg-distribution-2026, thailand-ecommerce-logistics-2026, philippines-healthtech-2026 — all from seed-demo era). EN/JA/KO with locale-aware CTA label.
- **Cache headers** (`874b495`) — Vercel default for static was `Cache-Control: public, max-age=0, must-revalidate` → browser re-fetched kira.css + nav.js + i18n.js + live-counts.js on every navigation. New `headers` block in `vercel.json`: `/css/*` `/js/*` `/locales/*` get 10-min browser + 1-day edge + 7-day SWR; fonts get 1-year immutable; favicons + manifest get 7-day browser + 30-day edge. API s-maxage bumped: library-report + insight 300s→1800s, library-list + insights-list 120s→600s. Largest perceived-perf lift is the static-asset browser cache (no more revalidate round-trip per page nav).
- **Favicon site-wide** (`ca0b157`) — `favicon.svg` existed but only 23 of 51 HTML pages linked it. Moved injection into `nav.js` (`injectFavicon()`), generated PNG fallbacks from the SVG via transient `sharp` install: `favicon-16/32.png`, `apple-touch-icon.png` (180×180), `icon-512.png`, `favicon.ico` (PNG-content), plus `site.webmanifest` for PWA install. Theme color `#0B0D10` matches the brand-dark icon background. Idempotent via `data-kira-favicon` attribute.
- **6 stub insights cleaned** (`3ac7f40` + DB direct) — 6 seed `field-note` / `methodology` insights had title+excerpt seeded months ago but `body=NULL`. Detail page rendered the "Full article body is being written…" fallback (looked broken to buyers). Fix: (a) `UPDATE insight_translations SET status='draft' WHERE body IS NULL AND status='published'` (instant hide); (b) `/api/insights-list` adds `body=not.is.null` filter on translations + post-map drop of items without a published translation, total counts post-filter; (c) `/api/insight` returns 404 `body_empty` when resolved translation has no body; (d) gen'd 6 brand-aligned bodies in-session (3000-3600 chars each, KIRA voice, source tags inline) and UPDATEd them back to `status='published'`. The bodies cover SG family offices, MY cloud kitchens, methodology page, PH telemedicine, TH EEC logistics, ID warung instrumentation. Slugs unchanged.
- **Insight cron cwd bug** (`8c271b4` + 4 local SKILL.md edits) — `kira-insight-{0700,1100,1500,2100}` schedulers used `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` to derive cwd. Cron fires launch in the parent dir (gotcha from `feedback_scheduled_task_cwd_parent.md`), so `git rev-parse` always failed and every fire exited with `not in git, no-op` since Phase Q.2 launched 2026-05-25. All 13 EN insights in prod were from manual fires inside the repo, not from the cron. Fix mirrors the batch SKILL.md pattern: hardcoded DELL paths + "ignore the playbook's git rev-parse step" override. Machine-local change (SKILL.md not committed); commit is just the memory note documenting the gotcha. **vnc-f4 needs the same SKILL.md edit applied locally.**
- **Insights polish verification** — Earlier session's insights polish (commit `cc3124c`, chart CSS + search box + related insights) verified live on prod via curl: kira.css ships `.article-body svg` scoped CSS, `/en/insights/` has search input EN/JA/KO localized (`placeholder="Search by topic, country, industry…"` / `トピック、国、産業で検索…` / `주제, 국가, 산업으로 검색…`), `/api/insight` returns `relatedInsights[3]`, `_view.html` renders `.related-insights-grid`.

Also confirmed: **migration 011 (reports-html bucket) is already live** — 30 of 30 published-report HTML previews uploaded; `/api/preview-html?slug=...` returns 200 with proper `text/html` Content-Type; `_view.html` iframe is wired. No owner click-through needed for that one.

Phase R (companies directory) — Henry brainstormed Mordor's playbook with me but parked it to think more. Memory note `project_r_seo_companies_directory.md` still says "brainstorm (not started)".

## Previous state (2026-05-24 — KIRA Studio MVP session)

- **Phase N — KIRA Studio (UC2+UC3 unified, subdomain) shipped to code; owner click-throughs pending.**
  - New subdomain `studio.kiraresearch.com` for self-serve report gen. Same repo, same Vercel project, same Supabase. Logged-in users only.
  - Single flow: landing page → topic input (optional file attach: PDF/DOCX/XLSX/CSV/TXT, up to 5 × 25 MB) → background gen → live progress page (Supabase-poll + stage timeline) → viewer page with HTML iframe + PDF download.
  - Architecture: Vercel host-rewrite (`/:path*` w/ host filter → `/studio/:path*`). Per-route `maxDuration: 800` on `api/studio-jobs.js` (Vercel Pro plan). Worker uses `@vercel/functions` `waitUntil()` to keep the function alive after returning 202.
  - 2 new tables (`studio_jobs`, `studio_reports`) + 2 private storage buckets (`studio-inputs`, `studio-reports`). RLS scoped to `user_id = auth.uid()`. Migration 010.
  - 3 new API endpoints: `/api/studio-jobs` (POST create + GET poll), `/api/studio-upload` (file → bucket), `/api/studio-report` (GET signed URLs + DELETE soft-archive).
  - Worker (`api/_lib/studio-worker.js`) runs Stages 1, 3, 4 (web_search tool), 5 (parallel per-section), 7 (assemble + render-pdf) via Anthropic SDK. Reuses existing `/api/render-pdf` for PDF. Reuses skill's `master_styles.css` (bundled via `includeFiles` in vercel.json).
  - No watermark on Studio PDFs — visually identical to consulting reports per Henry's brief. Anti-positioning blacklist enforced via system prompt + post-gen scrub.
  - Profile page (`/[locale]/profile`) gets a "KIRA Studio" CTA card surfaced above purchases. Nav adds a "Studio" link visible only to logged-in users.

## Previous state (2026-05-22 — light theme + profile page session)

- **Latest changes:**
  - **Profile / "My Library" page** added: `/[locale]/profile` lists user's purchased reports with title/locale chip/country/industry/year/purchase date + "Open" + "Download PDF" actions. New `api/library-my-purchases.js` (auth-gated GET) joins `purchases × living_reports × report_translations`. PDF download reuses existing `library-content.js` for signed URLs (1h TTL). `/profile` → `/en/profile` redirect in `vercel.json`. nav.js shows "My Library" link only when localStorage has a `sb-*-auth-token` (cheap heuristic; profile page itself does proper auth check). i18n keys `nav.myLibrary` added to all 3 locales. 3 profile.html files (EN/JA/KO) all identical — copy is in-page JS keyed by URL locale, so a single template handles all locales.
  - **Email purchase receipts** are ACTIVE in prod (RESEND_API_KEY set). `api/_lib/email.js` `sendPurchaseReceipt` fires after every successful PayPal capture. `project des/CLAUDE.md` note about "Manual transactional Year 1" is now stale.
  - **Light editorial theme** shipped via `feat/theme-light-touch` → merge `5733c80`. White bg + deep slate-navy ink (`#0F172A`) + KIRA blue accent. Mức 2 (token flip + softened) — skipped Mức 3 full McKinsey redesign as over-engineering. Library card stretch bug fixed (`ed2813e` — `align-items: start` on `.lib-grid`). Reversible via `git revert 067e805`.
- **Previous session state:** `ee6498d` — QC infra (Dependabot + CodeQL + ESLint + canonical injection + Lighthouse CI + smoke trigger switch).
- **Production:** live, Vercel auto-deploys on every push to main
- **Last fully-verified green CI run:** verify `ee6498d` (or latest) in Actions tab. 79 smoke checks should pass on prod.
- **CI workflows:**
  - `post-deploy-smoke.yml` — Playwright 79 checks against prod, **triggered on `deployment_status` (state=success, env=Production)** — no longer push+sleep
  - `quality.yml` — ESLint on push + PR (rules: `no-undef`, `no-unused-vars`)
  - `codeql.yml` — security-extended JS scanning on push + PR + weekly
  - `lighthouse.yml` — LHCI 3-run audit on 6 prod URLs, manual + weekly (not per-push)
  - `dependabot.yml` config — weekly npm + GH-actions updates, grouped minor/patch
- **Smoke tests:** 79 shallow checks at `tests/smoke.spec.js` covering static pages × 3 locales (incl. 2 new custom-research subpages = 6 routes), slug rewrites, root redirect, legacy redirects (now retargeted to specific subpages), admin auth gates (incl. `/en/admin/audit`), public APIs (incl. relatedInsights field on library-report), **SEO surface (robots.txt + sitemap.xml + sitemap-{locale}.xml + hreflang + Organization JSON-LD + per-report Product JSON-LD + per-article Article JSON-LD + canonical link with utm-strip)**, **dynamic templates have no fatal module parse error**, **/auth has no sub-resource 404s**, **/api/_lib/email is not a public route**, **lead honeypot path returns 200 JSON**, **insights pagination (`?page=2` survives)**, **mobile viewport 375×667 has no horizontal scroll across 6 key pages + nav burger visible**, **branded 404 returns status 404 + locale-swapped title for /ja/missing-path**.
- **SEO surface verified in prod** (curl ground truth): `/robots.txt` ✅, `/sitemap.xml` returns sitemap index ✅, `/sitemap-{en,ja,ko}.xml` return urlsets with hreflang annotations ✅. Schema markup verification by post-deploy smoke.
- **Open warning:** GitHub Actions Node.js 20 deprecation. Forced migration to Node 24 by 2026-06-02. Non-blocking — action authors will update before then.

```

Key Vercel rewrite pattern (final, stable):
```
/<locale>/reports/:slug  → /en/reports/_view
/<locale>/insights/:slug → /en/insights/_view
```
Two things matter here:
- `:slug` is plain (no inline regex). Vercel's path-to-regexp silently
  drops complex patterns; filesystem check runs before rewrites so
  concrete files (`_view.html`, `template.html`) still serve directly.
- Destination uses **no-extension form**. `cleanUrls` strips `.html`
  from rewrite destinations internally, so writing `_view.html` makes
  Vercel look for a file literally named `_view` (no extension) → 404.
  Writing `_view` lets cleanUrls forward-map to `_view.html` correctly.

## Owner action items (BLOCKING — owner must click through)

These are tasks only the owner can do (involve dashboards, not git):

### ⚡ Phase O (Studio credits) — required for billing to work

1. ☐ **Run `supabase/migrations/013_studio_credits.sql`** in Supabase dashboard → SQL editor.
   - Creates: `user_credits` (1 row/user, atomic balance) + `credit_transactions` (append-only ledger) + RLS + 2 RPC functions (`credit_add`, `credit_debit`) for atomic top-up / hold operations.
   - Idempotent. Safe to re-run. The final `RAISE NOTICE` line should print `user_credits:t credit_transactions:t credit_add:t credit_debit:t` — all four `t`. If any are `f`, screenshot and ping back.
2. ☐ **PayPal env vars already set?** — yes, Phase N already wired `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` + `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET` + `PAYPAL_MODE`. Studio credit checkout reuses them (same PayPal account = same dashboard for reconciliation). No new env var needed.
3. ☐ **Optional: set `STUDIO_URL` env var** to override the return URL PayPal uses after payment.
   - Default: `https://studio.kiraresearch.com`. Leave unset for prod.
   - Set to `http://localhost:3000` only for local PayPal sandbox testing (rare).

#### Verify Phase O works (after migration 013 runs)

1. Visit `https://studio.kiraresearch.com/billing` while signed in. You should see:
   - Balance card reading **0 credits**.
   - 4 pack cards: Starter $10, **Plus $25 (BEST VALUE)**, Power $50, Bulk $200.
   - Empty transaction history table with the "no transactions yet" placeholder.
2. Click **Buy with PayPal** on any pack → redirects to PayPal sandbox/live (depending on `PAYPAL_MODE`).
3. Complete the test payment. PayPal returns you to `/billing?paypal=success&token=...&PayerID=...`.
4. The page auto-captures the order — green banner reads `Top-up complete · +N credits · balance N`. Balance card updates. Transaction history shows the `Top-up` row.
5. Click **New report** in the nav. Balance pill should now appear top-right and the Generate button should be enabled. Generating a report deducts 100 credits and creates a `studio_debit` ledger row.
6. If a gen fails (kill the worker mid-run if testing), confirm a `studio_refund` row appears and balance restores to pre-gen.

Receipt email (Resend) fires automatically after each successful PayPal capture — uses the existing `RESEND_API_KEY` env from Phase E.

### ⚡ Phase N (KIRA Studio) — required before subdomain works

Do these 3 in order; after step 3, `studio.kiraresearch.com` should accept gen requests end-to-end:

1. ☐ **Run `supabase/migrations/010_studio.sql`** in Supabase dashboard → SQL editor.
   - Creates: `studio_jobs` + `studio_reports` tables, `studio-inputs` + `studio-reports` private storage buckets, RLS policies, FK back-references.
   - Idempotent. Safe to re-run if you re-paste the file. The final `RAISE NOTICE` line should print `studio_jobs:t studio_reports:t studio-inputs bucket:t studio-reports bucket:t` — if any are `f`, screenshot and ping back.
2. ✅ **`studio.kiraresearch.com` domain already added to Vercel.** (Verified 2026-05-24 — CNAME → `vercel-dns-017.com`, HTTPS active, served by the `kira-research` Vercel project.) No DNS action needed. The host-rewrite in `vercel.json` (commit `2a0a809`) routes the subdomain to `public/studio/*` automatically.
3. ☐ **Set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var in Vercel.**
   - Get an API key from console.anthropic.com → Settings → API Keys → **Create Key**. Copy it (starts with `sk-ant-`).
   - Vercel dashboard → Project `kira-research` → **Settings** → **Environment Variables** → **Add New**.
     - Name: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
     - Value: paste the key
     - Environments: tick **Production**, **Preview**, **Development** (all 3)
     - Save.
   - Trigger a redeploy so the new env is loaded: Vercel dashboard → **Deployments** → top deployment → **⋯** → **Redeploy**.
   - (Optional) Override the model: also add `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` = `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` (default in code if unset).

#### Verify Phase N works (after the 3 steps above)

1. Visit `https://studio.kiraresearch.com/` — should show the KIRA Studio landing. If it redirects elsewhere → DNS isn't ready yet, give it another 5-10 min.
2. Sign in with your existing kiraresearch.com account (auth is shared via `.kiraresearch.com` cookie domain).
3. Type a small topic (e.g. "Coffee market Vietnam 2027") → click **Generate report**.
4. The page redirects to `/jobs?id=<uuid>`. The progress bar should advance through Parse → Plan → Search → Draft → Render over ~8-14 min.
5. When complete, click **View report →** → an iframe loads the HTML + a **Download PDF** button works.
6. Bookmark the URL or use **My library** to see all your previous Studio reports.

### Previous owner action items

1. ☐ **Run `supabase/migrations/008_security_hardening.sql`** in dashboard SQL Editor — closes 3 Supabase advisor findings left over after 001-007:
   - (a) ERROR: `credit_costs` had RLS disabled (anon could read 12 rows). Migration enables RLS with no policies → deny-all for anon/authenticated, service-key bypasses (so the deferred Custom Research rebuild can still query).
   - (b) WARN: `add_credits` + `spend_credits` SECURITY DEFINER functions were callable by anon/authenticated via `/rest/v1/rpc/*`. Migration revokes EXECUTE from public/anon/authenticated. Functions remain in the DB for the deferred rebuild.
   - (c) WARN: 3 functions (`add_credits`, `spend_credits`, `set_updated_at`) had mutable search_path. Migration pins to empty.
   - Idempotent. Run after confirming 001-007 are all applied (they are, per 2026-05-21 verification).
2. ☐ **Enable Leaked Password Protection** — Supabase dashboard → Authentication → Settings → toggle "Leaked password protection" ON. Auth feature, no SQL path.
2b. ☐ **Run `supabase/migrations/009_audit_log.sql`** — adds the `audit_log` table that backs `/en/admin/audit`. All admin write paths (`admin-reports`, `admin-insights`, `admin-transactions`, `admin-aggregators`, `admin-upload-pdf`) now `logAudit()` to this table fire-and-forget. Without the table, those logAudit calls 404 silently — no functional impact, but the audit viewer stays empty. Run after 001-008.
3. ☐ **Enable Vercel Analytics + Speed Insights** — Vercel dashboard → kira-research → **Analytics** tab → click "Enable". Same for **Speed Insights** tab. Free tier: 2,500 events/month (plenty for Year 1). `nav.js` already injects `/_vercel/insights/script.js` + `/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js` on every public page; scripts 404 silently until owner flips the toggle. After enabling, real-user data shows up in the dashboard within ~30 min.
4. ☐ **Lighthouse perf audit on prod** (Phase 10.1) — run before soft launch. Two paths:
   - **Quick path (recommended):** PageSpeed Insights — go to https://pagespeed.web.dev/, paste each of the 6 URLs below, screenshot scores. Target ≥90 on all 4 categories (Performance / Accessibility / Best Practices / SEO):
     - `https://kiraresearch.com/en/`
     - `https://kiraresearch.com/en/library`
     - `https://kiraresearch.com/en/insights/`
     - `https://kiraresearch.com/en/methodology`
     - `https://kiraresearch.com/ja/`
     - `https://kiraresearch.com/ko/`
   - **Detailed path:** Chrome DevTools → Lighthouse panel → Mobile + Desktop runs per URL. Captures filmstrip + suggestions.
   - Send any score < 90 back here — Claude can fix render-blocking resources / preload hints / image sizing / unused CSS in code; perf hits from external services (Supabase, Fontshare) are mostly unfixable from our side and acceptable.

### Done (no further action needed)

- ✅ **Migrations 001-007 applied** (verified via MCP 2026-05-21): leads, living_reports + report_translations, insights + insight_translations, purchases + downloads tables present; 6 legacy tables dropped; `aggregator_submissions` + `aggregator_sales` exist with RLS enabled.
- ✅ **Legacy Storage buckets deleted** (owner confirmed 2026-05-21): `frameworks` (23 obj) + `reports` (132 obj, ~38MB) removed via Dashboard → Storage UI. Active bucket `reports-pdfs` (private, 32MB cap, application/pdf) remains for PDF uploads.
- ✅ **Vercel env vars set**: `ADMIN_EMAILS`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`, `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID`, `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET`, `PAYPAL_MODE`, `APP_URL`, `RESEND_API_KEY` (+ optional `RESEND_FROM`).
- ✅ **Resend domain verified + API key live** — purchase receipts + lead notifications go out for real (no longer no-op).
- ✅ **GSC sitemaps submitted** — `sitemap-{en,ja,ko}.xml` added per locale property.
- ✅ Repo is public, GitHub Actions running free
- ✅ Smoke CI workflow live and green (60 checks)
- ✅ `/en/reports/<slug>` + `/en/insights/<slug>` rewrites verified by CI
- ✅ Legacy URL redirects (`/library.html`, `/report.html`, etc.) verified by CI
- ✅ Admin auth gate on `/en/admin/*` verified — unauthenticated users redirected
- ✅ Public API endpoints respond with JSON, leads endpoint rejects GET, admin-leads rejects unauth
- ✅ SEO surface live: `/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml` (index), `/sitemap-{en,ja,ko}.xml` (per-locale with embedded hreflang). Per-page `<link rel="alternate">` injected by nav.js on every page load.

## Open verification items (do these BEFORE picking next sprint)

End of 2026-05-20 session: code is shipped, owner has owner-blocker items still in progress. New session should confirm these are green before starting any new sprint, since several next-queue items depend on this infra being live.

Status as of 2026-05-21 late session:

1. ✅ **CI green** — verify on commit `3f250e5`. 78 smoke checks should all pass.
2. ✅ **Supabase tables + storage buckets verified via MCP** — all 7 migrations 001-007 applied. Migration 008 verified (credit_costs RLS=true, EXECUTE grants=0, search_path pinned). Legacy buckets (`frameworks`, `reports`) deleted. `reports-pdfs` private bucket remains.
3. ☐ **Bug #1 admin redirect (Year 1 test)** — owner-side smoke. Henry must sign in at `/auth` (email+password, not just email-verify), then visit `/en/admin/`. Confirm KPI dashboard renders. If still bounced, check `ADMIN_EMAILS` Vercel env value matches account email. Note: Henry confirmed ADMIN_EMAILS is set, so should work on next attempt.
4. ✅ **Schema markup / Article JSON-LD verified by CI** — smoke tests cover `script#ld-product`, `#ld-breadcrumb`, `#ld-article`, `#ld-organization` selectors + `pageerror` filter on `/en/reports/vietnam-fintech-2026` and `/en/insights/vietnam-sme-lending-shift`.
5. ☐ **End-to-end PDF upload + purchase (Year 1 test)** — owner-side. Once admin works (item 3), upload test PDF via `/en/admin/reports` → buy in incognito with non-admin PayPal sandbox account → download via post-purchase link.
6. ☐ **Migration 009 run** — owner runs `supabase/migrations/009_audit_log.sql` to create `audit_log` table. Until then, `/en/admin/audit` viewer shows empty + all `logAudit()` calls in admin endpoints fail silently (no functional impact, but no audit trail captured).
7. ☐ **Vercel Analytics + Speed Insights enabled** — owner toggles both in Vercel dashboard. Scripts already injected by nav.js, just need the products turned on to receive data.

## Next queue

All sprints with a code-side deliverable are now SHIPPED. QC baseline
(lint, code scanning, deps updates, perf budget) also shipped this
session — see "Done backlog (QC infra session)" below.

**Code blocker = 0.** What's left is either owner-side (content + outreach)
or polish that can wait for actual signal from production traffic.

**Owner-side (does NOT need Claude):**
- **Content production (Phases 1 + 6)** — produce 50+ EN reports via Henry's Claude-chat workflow (Max sub). Each report: pick from 1000-report archive → Claude refresh → translate to JA + KO → native reviewer QA → upload via `/en/admin/reports`.
- **Sprint 8.2 — JA report translations** — same workflow, paste EN into Claude chat → JA.
- **Sprint 9.2 — KO report translations** — same workflow, KO.
- **Sprint 8.3 — JA aggregator distribution (GIIResearch)** — Henry's outreach work, fully manual Year 1.
- **Sprint 9.3 — KO aggregator distribution** — same pattern as JA.
- **G — Native reviewer QA pass on JA/KO** — first 10-20 reports per locale, $50-100/locale on Upwork.
- **Phase 10 — Polish & launch** — Lighthouse CI is now wired (`lighthouse.yml`, manual + weekly); owner can trigger via Actions tab before soft launch. Mobile visual QA on real iOS/Android still owner-side. Soft launch announcement + 30-day metrics monitoring next.

**Possible future code work (only when signal justifies):**
- **Sentry error tracking** — deferred from QC session, needs owner to create Sentry account + add `SENTRY_DSN` env var. Wire frontend (browser SDK injected via nav.js) + serverless (per-function init). MCP server already configured.
- **Sprint 4.2 — featured ranking drag-drop** — needs `featured` + `featured_rank` columns on `living_reports`. Build when Henry wants manual library curation.
- **Phase 7.3 — internal linking expansion** — Sprint 8 shipped insights-on-report. Could extend to insights-cross-link-insights, or reports-cross-link-reports. Defer until content corpus grows.
- **Vercel Analytics → admin dashboard** — Web Analytics is enabled; once Year 1 traffic is non-trivial, the API exposes per-page view counts. Could surface in `/en/admin/reports` Stats column. Defer until there's data.
- **Re-add sign-out to public nav** — currently only available on admin pages. Users who buy a report can't sign out from any public page; would need nav.js to render an auth control when `kiraAuth.getUser()` returns a user.

### Done backlog (QC infra session — 2026-05-21 evening)

- ✅ **Dependabot** (`a87fa77`) — weekly npm + GH-actions updates, minor/patch grouped per ecosystem, majors get their own PR. Daily security advisories still fire instantly.
- ✅ **CodeQL** (`a87fa77`) — security-extended JS scanning on push + PR + weekly cron. Findings show up in repo Security tab.
- ✅ **ESLint flat config** (`b8ca9e3`) — `no-undef` + `no-unused-vars` only, globals partitioned per folder. `quality.yml` CI gate. Initial pass surfaced 5 real bugs in `api/admin-*`: undeclared `user` in admin-aggregators (was `me`), `const row` redeclared in admin-reports + admin-insights translation upsert, unused `catch (e)` in leads + library-content.
- ✅ **Canonical tag** (`2091e7c`) — `<link rel="canonical">` injected by nav.js on every page, hardcoded to `https://kiraresearch.com` + pathname. Strips utm_*/fbclid/etc. — important for FB Ads attribution + indexing hygiene. 1 new smoke test.
- ✅ **Lighthouse CI** (`ade8208`) — `.lighthouserc.json` + `lighthouse.yml`. 3-run audit against 6 prod URLs (3 locales × key pages). Budgets: Perf ≥ 0.85, A11y ≥ 0.90, Best Practices ≥ 0.90, SEO ≥ 0.95. Manual + weekly cron — not per-push.
- ✅ **Smoke trigger fix** (`ee6498d` + `3b39c54`) — switched from `push` + sleep(60) + curl-200 to `deployment_status` (state=success, env=Production). Eliminates the race where smoke could pass on stale cached prod code. Concurrency block dropped after first run got killed mid-step by overlapping preview deploys.
- ✅ **auth.html layout fix** (`243bde5`) — dropped `/js/nav.js` from the chromeless sign-in page; nav was injecting unstyled header/footer that flex-aligned into a visual mess.
- ✅ **Speed Insights drop** (`d1a4b1d`) — owner opted out (paid product). Removed script injection from nav.js to avoid 404 on every page.

### Done backlog (prior 2026-05-21 session — 10 sprints)

- ✅ **Migration 008 — security hardening** (`714b9f0`) — RLS credit_costs + REVOKE add/spend_credits + pin search_path. Verified live via MCP.
- ✅ **Sprint 7.1 — Insights pagination** (`8aa3b82`) — PAGE_SIZE=12, `?page=N`, pushState, EN/JA/KO localized.
- ✅ **Phase 10.1 — Mobile smoke + Lighthouse runbook** (`e416629`) — 7 new smoke tests at 375×667; PageSpeed Insights runbook for owner.
- ✅ **Sprint 5.1 — Custom-research subpages** (`1185709`) — 6 new pages EN/JA/KO × market-analysis/strategy-builder. Legacy /report + /strategy-builder redirects retargeted.
- ✅ **Sprint 7.2 — Content production admin** (`07d0af8`) — re-scoped: no LLM auto-gen. `published_at` schedule gate. "Get the full report" CTA upgrade.
- ✅ **Vercel Analytics + Speed Insights** (`b7f0441`) — script injection via nav.js. Owner enables in dashboard.
- ✅ **Sprint 4.2 — Report sales stats** (`c601213`) — per-report completed/refunded/revenue in admin list + summary strip.
- ✅ **Internal linking — related insights on reports** (`49fa73a`) — scored match by country/industry/explicit_related. Up to 3 cards at bottom of report page.
- ✅ **Branded 404** (`8c96ed1`) — single file, locale auto-detect from URL path. EN/JA/KO copy + 3 action cards.
- ✅ **Sprint 4.1 — Admin audit log** (`3f250e5`) — migration 009 + `_lib/audit.js` helper + 5 admin endpoints wired + `/en/admin/audit` viewer with filter chips + per-row diff toggle.

### Done backlog (prior sessions)

- ~~**C — Sitemap.xml + robots.txt + full hreflang**~~ ✅ (`6bb331f`…`8bcb6d4`)
- ~~**D — PDF upload via Supabase Storage**~~ ✅
- ~~**E — Transactional email**~~ ✅ — Resend wired, domain verified
- ~~**7.3-remainder — Per-report schema markup + OG + JSON-LD**~~ ✅
- ~~**4.3 — Transactions + Users admin**~~ ✅ — also fixed `admin-stats.js` revenue $0 bug
- ~~**4.4 — Aggregators admin**~~ ✅ (`e7d5372` + migration 007)
- ~~**F — Legacy file cleanup**~~ ✅ (`a8a9206`)
- ~~**H — KPI dashboard**~~ ✅ (`eb05464`)

## Hard constraints (do NOT violate)

From `project des/CLAUDE.md` — repeated here so a new session sees them immediately:

- ❌ Never position as "AI-powered platform / SaaS / app" — we are a **research house**
- ❌ Never claim volume ("1000+ reports", "thousands of studies")
- ❌ Never lead with "AI" in marketing copy — only mentioned on `/methodology`
- ❌ Never use competitor names in copy: Mordor, Frost, Euromonitor, Synovate, Ipsos
- ❌ Never use "Claude" or "McKinsey" in UI copy
- ❌ Never give CLI instructions to owner — always click-through (Vercel/Supabase/GitHub UI)
- ❌ Never use Next.js syntax in `vercel.json` (no `beforeFiles` / `afterFiles`)
- ✅ Brand voice: "our analysts" / "our research team" / "we" — never "our platform"
- ✅ Trilingual EN/JA/KO from Day 1, flat $39 pricing Year 1

---

## Gotchas learned the hard way

1. **Vercel blocks deploys if commit author email isn't matched to a GitHub account.**
   - First-time setup on a new machine, MUST run:
     ```
     git config user.email henryvn2004@gmail.com
     git config user.name  henryvn2004-arch
     ```
   - If already pushed bad commits, rewrite history with `git filter-branch --env-filter` then `git push --force-with-lease`.

2. **Vercel `cleanUrls: true` is required** or `/en/library` (file: `library.html`) 404s.

3. **Vercel rewrite slug patterns: keep them plain.** See gotchas #11 and #13 below — `:slug` (no inline regex) + no-extension destination is the only combination that reliably works with cleanUrls. The negative-lookahead pattern `:slug((?!_view$|template$).+)` that worked in earlier Vercel docs is silently dropped by their current parser.

4. **`package-lock.json` committed; CI uses `npm ci`.** ESLint + LHCI session added the lock file; all 3 workflows (smoke, quality, lighthouse) use `npm ci --no-audit --no-fund` for reproducibility. Don't downgrade to `npm install`.

5. **No hardcoded secrets in `public/`** — that folder is publicly served. Anon Supabase keys are OK (they're meant to be public, protected by RLS). Anything else = leak.

6. **Reading file from wrong shell cwd** — after `cd kira-research && ...`, the shell stays inside `kira-research/`. Subsequent `cd kira-research` errors. Always `pwd` first or use absolute paths.

7. **`.logo-mark` exists in TWO places** — `nav.js` injects it in the top nav AND in the footer. Playwright strict-mode (default) errors when a `locator('.logo-mark')` matches both. Always scope to `.nav-wrap .logo-mark` (or `.kira-footer .logo-mark` for the footer check) — or use `.first()` for quick triage.

8. **Page titles use mixed case `"KIRA Research"`**, not all-caps `"KIRA RESEARCH"`. Brand mark in nav is rendered all-caps via the CSS class `.logo-mark`, but `<title>` text is mixed case. Test with `/KIRA Research/i` or just `/KIRA/i`.

9. **`cleanUrls: true` strips `.html` from URLs** — admin JS redirects to `/auth.html` but the browser lands on `/auth`. Any URL assertion involving HTML files must accept both forms: `/\/auth(\.html)?(\?|$|\/)/`.

10. **`cleanUrls` BREAKS redirects whose source ends in `.html`** — Vercel normalizes `.html` requests FIRST (308 to no-extension), then matches redirects against the normalized path. So `{ "source": "/library.html", ... }` never fires because by the time the redirect runs, the path is already `/library`. Always write redirect sources in the no-extension form (`/library`, `/about`, etc.).

11. **`cleanUrls` ALSO breaks rewrites whose `destination` ends in `.html`** — when the destination is `/foo/_view.html`, Vercel applies cleanUrls to the rewrite destination and looks for a file at `/foo/_view` (no extension), which doesn't literally exist on disk → 404. Write rewrite destinations in the no-extension form too (`/foo/_view`). The cleanUrls forward map handles serving `_view.html` from there.

12. **Legacy root HTML files SHADOW redirects** — `public/library.html`, `report.html`, etc. (from the platform era) make their corresponding redirects no-op because filesystem lookup wins. When adding a redirect for a path, ALSO delete the file at that path if it exists.

13. **Rewrite slug patterns: keep them simple.** Vercel's path-to-regexp silently rejects complex inline patterns like `:slug((?!_view$|template$).+)` — the rule loads but never matches. Use plain `:slug` (single segment). Filesystem check runs before rewrites, so concrete files like `_view.html` and `template.html` still serve directly.

14. **`auth.html` is intentionally chromeless** — it has its own inline CSS (centered card) and does NOT link `/css/kira.css`. Don't add `/js/nav.js` to it; nav.js injects the public header + footer into `<body>`, which then renders as unstyled text and gets flex-aligned by the body's centering rules into a visual mess. Sign-out from public nav is intentionally absent (auth UI lives on admin pages); future fix would re-add it to nav.js.

15. **ESLint flat config + 2 rules** — `eslint.config.js` enforces `no-undef` + `no-unused-vars` only. Globals are partitioned per-folder: `public/**/*.js` gets browser globals + `supabase`/`kiraAuth`/`db`/`kira`; `api/**/*.js` + `tests/**/*.js` get Node globals; `tests/**` additionally allows `document`/`window` for `page.evaluate()` callbacks. Don't add stylistic rules — the goal is bug-catching, not formatting. CI gate at `quality.yml`. Bugs the initial pass surfaced: undeclared `user` in `admin-aggregators.js` (actor was named `me`), `const row` redeclared in `admin-{reports,insights}.js` translation upsert.

## Pickup checklist for new Claude session

When this conversation continues on a different machine:

1. ✅ Read this file (you just did)
2. ✅ Read `project des/CLAUDE.md` for full project context (brand, schema, decisions)
3. ✅ Skim `project des/site-architecture.md` if working on routing/pages
4. ✅ Skim `project des/workplan.md` if planning multi-sprint work
5. ✅ Run `git log --oneline -10` to see what's freshest
6. ✅ Check **Actions** tab on GitHub — latest smoke run pass/fail
7. ✅ Ask Henry: which next-queue item to pick, or any new bug surfaced
8. ✅ Before any commit: verify `git config user.email` = `henryvn2004@gmail.com`
9. ✅ Before any push: run `npm run test:smoke:local` if change touches routing/pages/forms

## Communication style

- Owner speaks Vietnamese mixed with English technical terms
- Mirror that register — informal Vietnamese for tone, English for system/code/UI terms
- Owner is non-technical: explain **why** + **click-through how**, never CLI to owner
- Be honest about tradeoffs and risks; flag blockers explicitly
- Use TaskCreate/TaskUpdate for multi-step work; one-off small tasks can skip
- After completing a workplan sprint: tick its checkbox in `project des/workplan.md`, update the Workplan-progress matrix in this file, and bump "Current state" date
